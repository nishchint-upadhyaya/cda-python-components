# Programming the IoT - CDA Python Components
This is the source repository for the Python components related to my Programming the Internet of Things book and Connected Devices IoT course. These are shell wrappers ONLY and are not a solution set (which is a separately repository, not yet released). For convenience to the reader, some basic functionality has already been implemented (such as much of the application [ConstrainedDeviceApp.py], the configuration logic, consts, interfaces, and test cases).

Important notes on coding conventions in this repository:
 - Use of 'interfaces' (modules and classes beginning with 'I' followed by their proper name [e.g., IDataManager]):
   - Python doesn't have 'interfaces'. In keeping with the OO-related design concepts of all code throughout my book and discussed in my class, along with my goal of maintaining design and naming parity between the CDA (Python) and GDA (Java), I chose to declare 'interface' modules and classes for the CDA (which follow the same convention built into the GDA's Java repository). While they largely serve no functional purpose, I find the explicit definition of 'interfaces' helpful in terms of describing expected derived type contracts. In Python, these classes are essentially treated as empty concrete 'base' classes. They're not necessary functionally, but are helpful when teaching OO design concepts in my course.
 - Naming conventions:
   - Some of my naming conventions may not be considered 'Pythonic'. Where feasible, however, I do my best to follow the guidelines ('guidelines', not 'requirements') specified in [PEP-0008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), and remain consistent with my conventions throughout the code base. Examples:
     - Module names: I use CapWords for most module names. I find this easier to read* - partly because I'm accustomed to it. It's also easier for teaching when comparing functionality between the CDA and GDA. The exception within the CDA is for test cases, where the module name begins with 'test_' followed by the CapWords module name.
     - Class names: I use CapWords.
     - Function names: I use camelCase. Again, I find this easier to read* vs the convention that uses underscores to separate words.
     - Variable names: These follow the same convention as function names, again, for readability*.
     - *I recognize that the concept of 'readability' may be somewhat subjective.
- Tests:
  - The test path (tests) has two sub-directories - one for 'unit' tests, one for 'integration' tests. For the short term, th means that the path hierarchy differs slightly from the main source tree (under 'piot') due to the inclusion of 'unit' and 'integration' as parent paths for what is essentially a shared path convention as the main source tree. This allows the user to run all unit tests (and only unit tests) without bothering with setup and configuration for external components often necessary to run the integration tests.
- Final notes:
  - The code in this repository is largely comprised of shell classes that are designed to be implemented by the reader and are NOT solutions. These shell classes and their relationships respresent a notional design that aligns with the requirements listed in [Programming the IoT Requirements](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/5). These requirements encapsulate the programming exercises presented in my book [Programming the Internet of Things: An Introduction to Building Integrated, Device to Cloud IoT Solutions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401).

## How to use this repository
If you're reading [Programming the Internet of Things: An Introduction to Building Integrated, Device to Cloud IoT Solutions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401), you'll see a tie-in with the exercises described in each chapter and this repository. Most of the code in the main src tree is NOT implemented by design. It's intended for you - as the reader of my book (and possibly a student in one of my IoT courses) - to implement by filling in the implementation details as you work through each exercise.

A solution set is available, although I haven't yet released it. Stay tuned for updates on this topic.

## This repository aligns to exercises in Programming the Internet of Things
These components are all written in Python3, and correlate to the exercises designed for the Constrained Device Application (CDA) specified in my book [Programming the Internet of Things: An Introduction to Building Integrated, Device to Cloud IoT Solutions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401).

Since Python is also used for various cloud computing activities, there are other components that may be introduced as Cloud Service Functions (CSF) in the future, as they will share some of the common data management code written for the CDA exercises.
